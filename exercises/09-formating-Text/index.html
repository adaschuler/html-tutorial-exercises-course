		<strong><h1>This will be your heading</h1></strong> <br />
		Then, you start talking about same interesting stuff that nobody wants to read<br />
		Then you can quote someone to add credibility:<br />
		<blockquote cite="https://www.google.cl/">
			A quotation is a handy thing to have about, saving one the trouble of thinking for oneself, always a laborious business.<br />
			-A.A. Milne, If I May
		</blockquote>
		Finally you can have some bullets to summarize everything, after all, new generations have this things in common:<br />
		<ul>
			<li>Don't like to read long texts.</li>
			<li>Have the spawn of attention of a bird.</li>
			<li>Skip long paragraphs straight to the bullet points.</li>
		</ul>
